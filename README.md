# ML-UsedCarData

The task is to predict the list price of US Used Cars from a subset of attributes. The data used is from the US Used Cars dataset on Kaggle, posted by Ananay Mital. This analysis will explore the structure of the data to identify a small number of attributes that could plausibly correlate well with price. Using ML methods, we will attempt to answer this question. Our decision on what method to use will be based on derived models and predictions. The performance measure we will use to analyze these models is RMSE or Root Mean Square Error.
 
Variables the model models used to predict Price:
- Mileage
- Highway Fuel Economy
- City Fuel Economy
- Owner Count
- Engine Displacement
- Year
- Horsepower
